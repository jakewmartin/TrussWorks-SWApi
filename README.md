# TrussWorks-SWAPI Project

Since the project is incomplete, running the program requires an IDE capable of using Jupyter Notebooks.

The intention of this program is to pull from the Star Wars API all of the planet's names, climate, famous residents, terrain, population, diameter, and url. The application also calculates the surface area of the planet containing water. All of this information is exported into a .csv and html file.

To run the program simply download the StarWarsAPI.ipynb and execute. Expected output is index.html file that contains a formatted table containing relevant data. Comments in code detail intent.
